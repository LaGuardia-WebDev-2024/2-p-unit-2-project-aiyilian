    <h1>Things I want to do: Travel Edition</h1>
    <h2>Camping</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not a super outdoorsy person per se but my mom's always really wanted
      to go camping so I do want to go with her one day. I also love the vibes
      of roasting marshmallows over a campfire with family and friends.
      Esccaping from the busy city life for a weekend into the woods also just
      sounds really comforting.

    <h2>Iceland: Aurora Borealis</h2>
    <p>
      Iceland is a beautiful country with really amazing scenery and culture. I
      would love to stay at a cozy lodge or cottage in Iceland and at night me
      and my family would go out and look for the Aurora Borealis. I would also love
      to see the stars without any pollution obsturcting them. In New York it's
      really hard to see stars even on clear nights because of how much light
      pollution there is.
