    <h1>Things I want to do: Travel Edition</h1>
    <h2>Camping</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not a super outdoorsy person per se but my mom's always really wanted
      to go camping so I do want to go with her one day. I also love the vibes
      of roasting marshmallows over a campfire with family and friends.
      Esccaping from the busy city life for a weekend into the woods also just
      sounds really comforting.

    <h2>Iceland: Aurora Borealis</h2>
    <p>
      Iceland is a beautiful country with really amazing scenery and culture. I
      would love to stay at a cozy lodge or cottage in Iceland and at night me
      and my family would go out and look for the Aurora Borealis. I would also
      love to see the stars without any pollution obsturcting them. In New York
      it's really hard to see stars even on clear nights because of how much
      light pollution there is.

    <h2>China: trying a bunch of food</h2>
    <p>
      I really want to go to China and try all of the different foods ethnic to
      different regions in the country. China's a massive country and each
      region has it's own staple dishes that I would love to taste. I would also
      love to go back and see some family and relatives that I haven't seen in
      ages.
